< ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on growing Vegan Cannabis.
- ðŸŒ± In Germany just passed a law which gives us the oprtunity to sell weed in "shops" fully Legal.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on a way to self-fund this project. It's mendatory to know that there is a huge diffrence bettween Vegan Cannabis and the comerciale Cannabis. 
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with creating a way to build quicky a huge traffic in Germany on a YouTube video from people who have searched for Vegan food, drink, eco system etc... In this video there is a presentation for the product. The way this will work is by Donations from the Vegan "maunority". 
- This is a nice idea, with no pressure or any investmant I will try to dominate the market, using Germany as a startup marketing. 
- ðŸ’¬ If some one have to spare some time to push bots, ads, searching engines and whatever way there is to get 1-5 million watchs. Looking for about 25-30% real traffic from real people.
